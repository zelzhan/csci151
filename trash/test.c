Starting with the Color and Coords struct definitions given in the first video clip, define another struct called
Square, which has an upper-left corner, a side length, an outline color, and a fill color.
(Assume that a squareâ€™s sides are parallel to the x and y-axes.) Declare a Square variable in main, and initialize all of its member values.
Similarly, define another struct for Rectangle, and declare and initialize a variable of that type.
